Suggested additional functionalities
a) Approval workflow

If your system allows Managers/Admins to approve purchase orders, you could add:

PATCH /api/v1/PurchaseOrder/{id}/approve

PATCH /api/v1/PurchaseOrder/{id}/reject

Useful for multi-step validation before receiving or processing.

b) Notifications / Alerts

You already implemented SignalR/email notifications for status changes.

Could add:

GET /api/v1/PurchaseOrder/{id}/notifications – list notifications for that PO.

Alerts for delayed delivery or partial receiving.

Sometimes POs include invoices, packing lists, or comments.

Endpoints like:

POST /api/v1/PurchaseOrder/{id}/attachments

GET /api/v1/PurchaseOrder/{id}/comments

d) Status history / audit trail

Track changes for compliance:

GET /api/v1/PurchaseOrder/{id}/history – who changed what, when.

e) Partial shipments / backorders

If items arrive partially:

PATCH /api/v1/PurchaseOrder/{id}/receive-partial
